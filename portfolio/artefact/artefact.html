					<p>Fire has always been central to human civilization; even though it's to be feared, and is uncontrollable. This element is a point of gathering, a literal central station where communities can be formed. We were very interested in this aspect of this element, and how it influences the behaviour of the people in its surroundings. Our 'Kind of Life' artefact aims to present these similar attributes to fire and encourage connections between people in their surroundings. It is able to stimulate this desired kind of life - one of conversing and sharing - out of the individuals invited to surround it, by responding once this is happening. By positively responding to unity and interplay between the individuals in the confined space, we aim to encourage this further. </p>

					<p>The artefact is in the middle of a dark room. Once individuals near it, the two Ultra sonic sensors will detect the change in distance between them. These sensors are placed on the exterior of the support box, facing one way. This will lead to all the LED strips increasing their intensity in light. Once close enough for the sound sensor on the external part of the artefact, some of the LED strips will respond to sound made by blinking respectfully. We will have a label encouraging the audience to talk amongst one another, so the sound sensor is placed at speaking level. Our artefact 'Kind of Life' will continue to adapt and react according to these changes in the room until we disable it.</p>
